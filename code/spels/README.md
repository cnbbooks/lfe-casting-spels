# Casting SPELs with LFE

*The OTP Version*

Start the LFE REPL (which will first compile all the modules):

```bash
$ make otp-repl
```

Once in the REPL, start the game server and then load up the game commands:

```lisp
Erlang/OTP 17 [erts-6.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [async-threads:10]

   ..-~.~_~---..
  (      \\     )    |   A Lisp-2+ on the Erlang VM
  |`-.._/_\\_.-';    |   Type (help) for usage info.

At this point, you are ready to play!


Here's a walk-through:

The wizard awakens from his slumber, greets you warmly, and thanks you for

Your reward, it seems, is a magical low-carb donut which he hands you ...
right before drifting off to sleep again.

You won!!
