We've mentioned the following resources so far:

* For a more in-depth and thorough introduction to LFE, see [The LFE Tutorial](http://lfe.io/tutorial/)
* To learn more about how to use the `rebar3` plugin we mentioned, see [The LFE rebar3 Plugin Command Reference](https://lfe-rebar3.github.io/)
* This is the old-skool [LFE User Guide](https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/blob/develop/doc/src/lfe_guide.7.md)

Additional resources:

* Some classic LFE Examples: [Example code](https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/tree/develop/examples) in the LFE repository
* Community-contributed libraries: [the lfex github org](https://github.com/lfex)
* Core code, tools, and on-line resources (docs, blog, etc.): [the lfe github org](https://github.com/lfe)
* There's always the blog, too: [The LFE Blog](http://blog.lfe.io/)

True mastery of LFE is not matter of syntax, though: it requires a deep
knowledge of Erlang/OTP and how to best apply that knowledge. The
[Erlang site](http://erlang.org/) has links to some of the really great Erlang books you can read.
Read them!
