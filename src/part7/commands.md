# Supporting Commands

Throughout the entirety of this little book, we've asked you, gentle coder, to suspend the horror of having to see the game state spit out at you with every command. At the beginning of this chapter, we proposed a solution for this -- the use of closures -- in order to hide the state data from the user experience. In the last section we successfully created a game server that will contain this state. That last piece of this puzzle, then, is now able to fall into place: a new set of game commands, specifically written to make use of our new game server.

We can also take this opportunity to do a little clean-up work on the command results. We will tackle the following

* Create a new command prompt that provides a separator between our last action + result and the new user prompt;
* Create a SPEL for sending a command to the server;
* Create command SPELs that make use of this general ``send`` SPEL; and
* Create a function that presents text to the user in a nicely-wrapped manner.

Let's finish up!

As just mentioned, we're going to want to put a separator between each command:

```lisp
(defspel sent-prompt ()
  '(list_to_atom (string:copies "-" 78)))
```

Not only does that help us keep the command history clearly delineated, it takes care of that pesky problem of seeing the return value from calling the ``(! ...)`` function.

Speaking of which: since we're going to be making so many calls to ``(! ...)`` (one for each command), how about we create a SPEL for that -- it will make things much cleaner:

```lisp
(defspel send (args)
  `(progn
    (! (whereis 'game-server) ,args)
    ',(sent-prompt)))
```

We had noticed earlier when making our first process-based server that the command ``hi`` was output to the user -- this is simply because it was the output of the last function inside the ``send`` command. What if we make the last function inside the ``send`` command return something that we *want* to see? ... like our new prompt! So that's what we've done :-)

Now let's create the commands that we will type: the SPELs that will send messages to our little game server:

```lisp
(defspel go (direction)
  `(send #(go ,direction)))

(defspel look ()
  `(send #(look)))

(defspel exits ()
  `(send #(exits)))

(defspel inv ()
  `(send #(inv)))

(defspel take (item)
  `(send #(take ,item)))

(defspel weld (subj obj)
  `(send #(weld ,subj ,obj)))

(defspel dunk (subj obj)
  `(send #(dunk ,subj ,obj)))

(defspel splash (subj obj)
  `(send #(splash ,subj ,obj)))
```

Now that we've got some new SPELs, let's try them out:

```lisp
lfe> (look)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
lfe>
You are in the living-room of a wizard's house. There is a wizard snoring loudly on the couch.
You see a whiskey-bottle on the ground. You see a bucket on the ground.
There is a door going west from here. There is a stairway going upstairs from here.
```

Look at that! No more state -- we're not passing it and we're not seeing it returned! The closures are taking care of that for us. We haven't abandoned the *functional programming way* -- our game code is still not mutating any data. We've just "hidden" the plumbing, as it were, with the raised floor of closures :-)

But ... the lines are a bit long. Let's make some changes to fix that. Here's
some code for wrapping long lines:

```lisp
(defun make-regex-str (max-len)
  (++ "(.{1," (integer_to_list max-len) "}|\\S{"
      (integer_to_list (+ max-len 1)) ",})(?:\\s[^\\S\\r\\n]*|\\Z)"))

(defun wrap-text (text max-len)
  (let ((find-patt (make-regex-str max-len))
        (replace-patt "\\1\\\n"))
    (re:replace text find-patt replace-patt
                '(global #(return list)))))

(defun wrap-text (text)
  (wrap-text text 78))
```

And we can use that to update our ``display-scene/1`` and ``display-exits/1`` functions:

```lisp
(defun display-scene (game-state)
  (io:format
    "~n~s~s~s"
    (lists:map
      #'wrap-text/1
      `(,(describe-location game-state)
        ,(describe-items game-state)
        ,(describe-exits game-state)))))

(defun display-exits (game-state)
  (io:format
    "~n~s"
    (list (wrap-text (describe-exits game-state)))))
```

Let's try again, with our display functions updated to wrap long text:

```
lfe> (stop)
#(status game-over)
lfe> (start)
#(status started)
lfe> (look)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
lfe>
You are in the living-room of a wizard's house. There is a wizard snoring
loudly on the couch.
You see a whiskey-bottle on the ground. You see a bucket on the ground.
There is a door going west from here. There is a stairway going upstairs from
here.
```

Ah, much better :-)

Well, it looks like we're finally ready to play our game!
