# About the Text

This book (available [here](http://lfe.io/casting-spels/))
is a work in progress, converting Dr. Conrad Barski's original Common Lisp
[comic book adventure game](http://www.lisperati.com/casting.html) to Lisp
Flavoured Erlang. It was very kind of Dr. Barski to share his work with the
Lisp community licensed as GNU Free Documentation, thus allowing others to
adopt it for their own preferred language.

Other editions of the book include:
 * [Clojure](http://www.lisperati.com/clojure-spels/casting.html)
 * [Emacs Lisp](http://www.lisperati.com/casting-spels-emacs/html/casting-spels-emacs-1.html)
