# Casting SPELs in LFE

*A Bold New LFE Take on the Common Lisp Comic Classic*

Anyone who has ever learned to program in Lisp will tell you it is very different from any other programming language. It is different in lots of surprising ways -- this comic book will let you find out how Lisp's unique design makes it so powerful!

This tutorial has small bits of Lisp code that are presented as it looks
when using the LFE REPL (the "interactive interpreter"). The LFE prompt looks
like this:

```lisp
lfe>
```

Code entered in the REPL looks like this:

```lisp
lfe> (+ 1 1)
```
```lisp
2
```

Results will come right afterwards, in their own text block, just like you saw in
that example just now.

When you copy the code from this book into your own LFE REPL, be sure
not to copy the ``lfe>`` prompt! Just copy the code :-)

What will you be copying, you ask? A-ha! This is the best part: **your own text
adventure game!**

First, though, we're going to have to cover some basics. But take heart: you'll be coding up some gamey goodness in no time ;-)
