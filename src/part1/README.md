# Getting Started

If you're new to LFE and haven't read the
[LFE Quick Start](http://lfe.io/rebar3-quick-start/), that might be a
good idea to do that -- you'll feel much more comfortable with the material in
this book if you have. If you never encountered a Lisp before, or if your
familiarity is rusty, we'd recommend reading through the original [Casting
SPELs in Lisp](http://www.lisperati.com/casting.html). That version is more
accessible to the Lisp new-comer.

That said, the next few sections will walk you through the steps necessary to
be able to run the code in the rest of this book.
