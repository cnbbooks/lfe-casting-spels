# Prerequisites

Here's what you need before we get started (links are to more resources,
should you be missing any of them):

* Erlang and `rebar3` need to be installed on your system; great instructions
   for both are [here](https://www.rebar3.org/docs/getting-started).
* You need to have `git` installed on your system.
* Developer/build tools for your system (instructions for this are very
  different between systems and can be found on the Web by searching for
  "install developer tools" or "build essential" for your operating system).

Once all of the above are set up on your system, you're ready to go! No need
to manually install anything: `rebar3` will take care of that for you!
