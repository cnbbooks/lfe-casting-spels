# Introducing the Game

As earlier stated, we're going to be creating a game. Our game is going to have some objects in it that the player can pick up and use. It's going to have places. It's going to have a player -- you! It's going to let you interact with it.

Things are going to get pretty deep, pretty quickly, so before we take the dive, let's cruise around in the shallow end. We're going to play in the LFE REPL a bit, defining some variables. Our game won't be using them in exactly this form. For now, though, it will be helpful for demonstrating a few things.
