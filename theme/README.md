# The LFE `mdbook` Theme

This repo is intended to be used as a git submodule in LFE book repos, so that all books may be maintained with the same theme from a single point.

When cloned/added as a git submodule, this repo's local directory in the book repo should be named `theme` and should be at the top-level, in the same parent directory as the book `src` directory.
