# Casting SPELs in Lisp

*The LFE Edition*

Anyone who has ever learned to program in Lisp will tell you it is very different from any other programming language. It is different in lots of surprising ways- This comic book will let you find out how Lisp's unique design makes it so powerful!

This tutorial has small bits of Lisp code that are presented as it looks
when using the LFE REPL (the "interactive interpreter"). The LFE prompt looks
like this:

```lisp
>
```

Code entered in the REPL looks like this:

```lisp
> (+ 1 1)
```
```lisp
2
```

Results will come right afterwards, in their own text block, just like you saw in
that example just now.

When you copy the code from this book into your own LFE REPL, be sure
not to copy the ``>`` prompt! Just copy the code :-)

What will you be copying, you ask? A-ha! This is the best part: **your own text
adventure game!**


## About

This Gitbook (available [here](http://lfe.gitbooks.io/casting-spels/))
is a work in progress, converting Dr. Conrad Barski's
[comic book adventure game](http://www.lisperati.com/casting.html) to Lisp
Flavoured Erlang. It was very kind of Dr. Barski to share his work with the
Lisp community licensed as GNU Free Documentation, thus allowing others to
adopt it for their own preferred language.
