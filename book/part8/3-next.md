## What's Next?

In order to make this tutorial as simple as possible, many details about how LFE works have been glossed or fudged over. The aim of this little book is to provide a fun exposure to some of LFE's ideas, not to provide an in-depth intorduction to the language, to distributed systems, and the theories behind these both, 

That being said, should the curious reader want to learn more, where can they go? And what was skipped in the first place?

Starting with the second bit first, here are some of the key points we have largely ignored:

* The differences between writing code in the REPL and creating proper projects complete with the appropriate directory structures, modules, etc.
* A discussion of the data types supported by LFE
* No in-depth discussion of records nor detailed information about the automatically-generated record macros
* No detailed explanation of higher-order functions
* Only a passing explanation of macros

so let's look at what those details are...
